# Credit-Card-Churn-Prediction
# Overview
In the Credit Card Churn Prediction Project, we focus on the vital task of predicting the churn rate of credit card users. Using dataset with 18 features per customer from Kaggle, the project uses deep learning model to analyze data including aspects of personal information, credit card details, usage patterns, and engagement metrics to predict churn activities. Finally we get a validation accuracy of 96%. With the insights gained from the analysis, banks can see where customer service can be improved. Furthermore, understanding churn patterns can help banks position themselves better in the competitive market.
# Pipline
* **Data Preparation**

  Process and clean data, including handling outliers and encoding categorical variables, with a focus on addressing overfitting and dataset imbalance by using SMOTE.
* **Modeling**

  Utilize a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) deep learning model, suitable for binary classification, with specific details on network layers and activation functions.
* **Model Optimization**

  Implement several optimization strategies to enhance model performance, such as increasing neurons in hidden layers and adding dropout layers.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization**

  Conduct grid search to find optimal hyperparameters for the model, including learning rate, dropout rate, and weight decay.
* **Implementation and Challenges**

  Address issues like dataset imbalance and false negatives in model predictions, using techniques like SMOTE for class distribution balancing.
* **Results and Evaluation**
